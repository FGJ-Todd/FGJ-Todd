## Project Experience

### Completed Projects

✅ **CloudSpeak1.0**: An important project I completed, it helped me grasp the basic software development process and skills, and deepen my understanding of team collaboration. I was responsible for designing and coding some modules, applying my knowledge to solve practical problems and accumulate valuable experience. 🚀

✅ **Sales, Purchasing and Inventory Management System Based on RuoYi**: Developing a sales, purchasing and inventory management system based on the RuoYi framework has further enhanced my understanding of framework usage and system development. This project improved my programming skills and taught me to customize systems according to business needs, laying a solid foundation for my future studies and projects. 💻

### Ongoing Projects

🚧 **blog**: A personal blog project for recording and sharing my learning insights, technical thoughts, and life moments. In this project, I try to use multiple tech stacks, continuously optimizing the blog's functionality and user experience to make it my own little world. 📝 Due to network issues, the blog link parsing was unsuccessful. You can check the validity of the webpage link and try again later. If you don't need to parse this link, you can proceed to the next part.

🚧 **CloudSpeak2.0**: As an upgraded version of the CloudSpeak project, I'm working hard to add more features and optimize the existing architecture. I hope to explore the integration of software development and AI through this project. 🔍

## Learning Direction and Goals

🎯 In the future, I aim to make greater progress in software development and AI. I'll delve into AI algorithms and models, exploring how to better apply AI technology to software development to enhance software intelligence and user experience. I'll also boost my big data processing capabilities to offer more effective technical solutions for complex problems. 📈
